 Enhanced Earthquake Map
This is an enhanced version of the previous earthquake visualization of mine (https://github.com/tysong0/gis_mapping_w3) by introducing the historical earthquake statistics by states. Now, one can not only see the location of individual earthquakes and their magnitude, but can also see the relative earthquake dangrousity of the different states of the US (incl. Puerto Rico) and check how many earthquake happened their historically. The data is retrieved from a database of NOAA (https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazard/eq-intensity.shtml). 

The inspiration of this webpage still comes from the New Jersey earthquake weeks ago and to keep a higher level of relevancy to NYC, the recent earthquake dataset for this webpage is kept unupdated as the version retrieved from just after the New Jersey quake (easy update can be realized by download and replace the dataset via the USGS website for earthquake updates, https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/).
